collect the state of the game 


stateOfGame(playerBoard){ 
    const gameFeed = [] (create empty array to capture current game state)

    for (let y = 0; y < playerBoard.length; y++) {  (loop through the board)
        for (let x = 0; x < playerBoard.length; x++)

        const cell  = playerBoard's coordinates (check if cell has been hit or missed if true add to history )

        gameFeed.push { x , y, result cell.isHit ? "hit" : "miss" }
        
    }    

    returning gameState 
    boardSize : length of playerBoard 
    previousMoves : history
