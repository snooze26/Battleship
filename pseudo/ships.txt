Create a class that harbors all the ships. no pun intended 

Create Ship object. with these properties: (type, length, hits = 0, sunk = false)

Extend Ship into the following types of ships and implement the values:
    Carrier: 5,  
    Battleship: 4 
    Destroyer: 3 
    Submarine: 3 
    Patrol Boat: 2 


Create a hit function that increases the hits to the user's ship
    hit(ship){ 
        increment ship.hit
    }

Create a function that calculates if a ship is sunk based on the length and number of hits recieved 
    isSunk() { 
        if ship hits equal ship's length then ship's sunk is true 
        create popup alert that ship is sunk 
    }
